# Ideas/Brainstorming

## Rarities
- Inferior (replaces Common)
- Mediocre (replaces Uncommon)
- Decent (replaces Rare)
- Great (replaces Epic)
- Superior (replaces Legendary)
- Flawless (replaces Mythic)
- Pristine
- EnTech Grade (replaces supreme)
- Unobtainable (Debug Items and or really really really rare items)

## Drops
First a number gets selected, if that number is equal to another number then it will determine the drop's rarity (going by 100)
- 0-50 = Common
- 51-75 = Uncommon
- 76-88 = Rare
- 88-94 = Epic
- 95-97 = Legendary
- 98-99 = Mythic
- 100 = Pristine

Then it will determine the drop that you get from the rarity pool with the random number being the number of the item in that pool, that is what you recieve then.
